Question: Can I remove the "get the plugin" hyperlink at the bottom of the widget ?

Answer: Yes you can. Although I'd prefer you wouldn't. But if you still want to here's what you need to do:

1. Unzip the bitcoin-ticker-widget.zip file
2. open the bicoin_widget.php file with any text editor (I use TextMate)
3. Delete this line: div id="get-the-plugin"><a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="#" target="_BLANK">Get the plugin</a></div>  (it should be line 244).
4. Zip all the files back together.
5. Refer to "Installation" to reinstall the plugin.
